bin/phpdoctest
==============

bin/phpdoctest is a little test runner I've added to Greg Thornton's
DocTest for PHP.

It doesn't support any commandline arguments, other than the files you
want to test.  Before running a doctest, the runner will chdir() to
the directory where the test resides, so your tests can refer to files
relative to that location.

Example:
--------

    user@host:~$ bin/phpdoctest docs/phpdoctest.txt
    1 items passed all tests:
       6 tests in phpdoctest.txt
    6 tests in 1 items.
    6 passed and 0 failed.
    Test passed.


Tests:
------

The following tests test running phpdoctest against the examples
included in the examples tree.  For these to work you will need to
have 'php' available in your PATH.


.. sourcecode:: php

   php > $cmd = "php ../bin/phpdoctest ../examples/subdir/tests.txt"; 
   php > $output = exec ($cmd);
   php > echo "$output\n";
   Test passed.

   php > $cmd = "php ../bin/phpdoctest ../examples/tests.txt"; 
   php > $output = exec ($cmd);
   php > echo "$output\n";
   ***Test Failed*** 2 failures.
